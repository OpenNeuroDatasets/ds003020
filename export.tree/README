## An fMRI dataset during a passive natural language listening task

This dataset now has a dataset descriptor currently available on biorxiv, that describes all of the data and code available for working with this dataset. It can be found:

## Dataset Derivatives

1. preprocessed data: fully preprocessed data as described in previous works.

2. textgrids: aligned transcripts of the stimulus with start and end point for each word and phoneme. 

3. pycortex-db: hand-corrected surfaces for each subject to be used in visualization. This is best used with the pycortex software. 

4. subject_xfms.json: a dictionary with the correct transformation for each subject to align the data to the surface.

5. respdict.json: a dictionary with the number of TRs for each story in the stimulus set.
